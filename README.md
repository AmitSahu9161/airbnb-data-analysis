# 🏡 Airbnb Data Analysis Project

This project focuses on analyzing an open Airbnb dataset using Python. The goal is to explore patterns in listing prices, room types, neighborhoods, availability, and user activity. Through data cleaning and visualization, we gain insights into Airbnb’s rental trends.

---

## 📌 Objectives

- Clean and preprocess the dataset
- Analyze price distribution and review activity
- Explore relationships between room type, location, and price
- Visualize trends over time and by neighborhood

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` – data manipulation
  - `NumPy` – numerical operations
  - `Matplotlib`, `Seaborn` – data visualization
- **Platform**: Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes over 100,000 Airbnb listings with 25+ columns, such as:
